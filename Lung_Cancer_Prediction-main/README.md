Lung_Cancer_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

This project aims to predict lung cancer by comparing the performance of 10 machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, 
and Random Forest, using a lung cancer dataset from data.world. 
Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. 
Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy at 90.29%, making it the best-performing model in the study.
